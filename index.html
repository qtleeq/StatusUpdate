            Hi Everyone, thank you for joining me. I've decided to recommit
            myself to making videos, and wanted to give an overview of what I am
            working on right now. Making my videos public on Rumble was a
            significant step in my life, as I am not supposed to have an
            internet presence but have decided the situation is too critical to
            keep them private.
          </p>

            I do not know how many people are familiar with the situation we now
            find ourselves in as a planet, all I know is that Americans we live
            in and control the most critical country on Earth.
